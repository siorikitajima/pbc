        <p>Use the six sets of sliders to filter the catalog down to what you are looking for based on rhythm, speed, mood, experimental and organic traits associated with the songs. We believe these sliders are an intuitive way to search our particular set of sound & music. You can add traditional keyword filters for artists, projects, instruments, genres, albums/collections and tags by using the magnifying glass icon.</p>

        <p>For the quickest start, click a preset such as ‘Commerce and Happiness’ or ‘Horror Drones’ which will set the filter sliders automatically. Then click the play icon above the search results to specify the number of tracks to add to the queue and begin playing. You can always refine the range of the sliders or add keywords to alter your search.</p>

        <p>Feel free to contact us at any point in your searching and listening if you would like to talk about your project and have us help you find or create exactly what you are looking for. We know our catalog inside and out (and we always have a mountain of unreleased material). Additionally, we are always composing custom music from full scores to short beats to remixes. Anything in the catalog can be thought of as a starting point for something new. Stems for all songs are readily available.</p>

You can then play the similar songs or add them to the play queue from the list. If you reach the end of your play queue, the same similar songs formula will be applied to continuously play music from the catalog.</p>

      <p>The PatternBased catalog, and the label more generally, is attempting to be much more privacy focused then most of the corporate, data collecting internet. We don’t even use cookies or analytics. You can use our catalog without giving us your information. In the future, we plan to build a login system so users can keep track of their order history, favorite tracks and do other useful things but you will always be able to play with the catalog without logging in.</p>

      details: `
        <p>The case for custom sound/music is an easy one to make for just about any project. Every event, every scene, every <i>thing</i> that needs music is different and thus the sound of it should be as well. A well done score and sound design can convey an incredibly specific mixture of ideas and emotions. A good composer can make that happen whether you are telling a story about the struggles of college athletes in the Mississippi swamplands, the future of technology in Singapore or you just need a unique bombastic build for the unveiling of your new label.</p>
        <p>We love the composing process and have created custom music for just about anything one could think of from films and shows to VR and interactive installations. We like working on unique original projects from around the world and are open to a wide range of budgets depending on the project. We dream of working on a colorful cartoon like Tuca and Bertie or Adventure Time or a VR experience that increases empathy or creates meditative states or perhaps UI sound design for the next generation of electric vehicles. Get at us with your wildest ideas.</p>

        <p>Stems (also sometimes called splits) are the individual components of a piece of recorded music, like drums or bass or vocals. Stems for just about every track in the catalog are available. This means the music can be stripped down or easily remixed/altered for your needs. Contact us if you hear a piece of music that would make a good starting point for your project.</p>

        <p>One of the primary goals of the PatternBased catalog is to help artists find music that they can license for their projects. There is a license button on all tracks and in the player that will start the license buy flow. If you are looking to license for personal or small projects, you will be able to complete the flow and receive your files immediately. For larger, bigger budget projects like national advertisements or films created in the studio system, we make it easy to contact us using the same button or feel free to use the form at <a href="https://patternbased.com/contact/" target="_blank">patternbased.com/contact/</a>.</p>

        <p>We are attempting to make this catalog extremely artist-centric. All projects, recording artists, featured artists and writers have individual pages that you can access by clicking on the artist’s name wherever they appear. From there, you can listen to all the songs that the artist has contributed to and follow links to the artists various pages and social media accounts and you are encouraged to contact them directly. All artists have equal splits on writing credits and the music is fully open sourced between the writers to do whatever they wish with. All PB artists have access to our Mojave Desert facilities as well as small grants and residencies via the Tiny Arts Prize through our not-for-profit sister entity <a href="https://bunnysantachi.com/" target="_blank">Bunny San Tachi</a>.</p>

        <p>If you are an independent smaller budget artist focused on forward thinking creations, we can offer discounted rates for licensing and possibly even composing. If you are just getting started in any type of creation, we might be able to help with music, code or advice. We love to be of service to our fellow creatives. We will also be restarting our <a href="https://bunnysantachi.com/" target="_blank">Bunny San Tachi</a> artist residency called the Tiny Arts Prize in southwest Japan possibly in 2023 depending on how the pandemic plays out.</p>

          <p>We are a small boutique entity and every penny counts. You can support us by licensing our music for your projects. If you are a listener of music, you can purchase our albums at <a href="https://albums.patternbased.com/" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a> which is our preferred 3rd party vendor. You can also purchase t-shirts and merch at <a href="https://patternbased.com/merch/" target="_blank">this page</a>. Or you can just enjoy our various creations and maybe spread the word to others who might enjoy or purchase our work. We are also working on a tip system for micropayments. You can even send us crypto if you are into that sort of thing.</p>
