        <p>Use the five sets of sliders to filter the catalog down to what you are looking for based on rhythm, speed, mood, experimental and organic traits associated with the songs. We believe these sliders are an intuitive way to search our particular set of sound & music. You can add traditional keyword filters for artists, projects, instruments, genres and tags by using the magnifying glass icon.</p>

Then click the blue stacked play icon above the search results to add the entire set of results to play queue and begin playing. You can always refine the range of the sliders or add keywords to alter your search.</p>

        <p>Feel free to contact us at any point in your searching and listening if you would like to talk about your project and have us help you find or create exactly what you are looking for. We know our catalog inside and out (and we always have a mountain of unreleased material). Additionally, we are always composing custom music from complete scores to short beats to remixes. Anything in the catalog can be thought of as a starting point for something new. Stems for all songs are readily available.

      title: 'Composing',
      details: `
        <p>The case for custom sound/music is a strong one for just about any project. Every event, every scene, every thing that needs music is different and thus the sound of it should be as well. A well done score and sound design can convey an incredibly specific mixture of ideas and emotions. A good composer can make that happen whether you are telling a story about the struggles of college athletes in the Mississippi swamplands, the future of technology in Singapore or you just need a unique bombastic build for the unveiling of your new label.</p>
        <p>We love the composing process and have created custom music for just about anything one could think of from films and Netflix/streaming shows to VR and interactive installations. We like working on unique original projects from around the world and are open to a wide range of budgets depending on the project. We dream of working on a colorful cartoon like Tuca and Bertie or Adventure Time or a VR experience that increases empathy or creates meditative states or perhaps UI sound design for the next generation of electric vehicles. Get at us with your wildest ideas.</p>

        <p>Stems (sometimes called splits) are the individual components of a piece of recorded music, like drums or bass or vocals. Stems for just about every track in the catalog are available. This means the music can be stripped down or easily remixed/altered for your needs. Contact us if you hear a piece of music that would make a good starting point for your project.</p>
